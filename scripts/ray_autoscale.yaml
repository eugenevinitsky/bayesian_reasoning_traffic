# cluster.yaml ========================================= 

# An unique identifier for the head node and workers of this cluster.
cluster_name: nliu_bayesian_1 #<YOUR NAME>

# The minimum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This number should be >= 0.
min_workers: 0 #<NUM WORKERS IN CLUSTER>

# The maximum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This takes precedence over min_workers.
max_workers: 0

# The autoscaler will scale up the cluster to this target fraction of resource
# usage. For example, if a cluster of 10 nodes is 100% busy and
# target_utilization is 0.8, it would resize the cluster to 13. This fraction
# can be decreased to increase the aggressiveness of upscaling.
target_utilization_fraction: 0.8

# If a node is idle for this many minutes, it will be removed.
idle_timeout_minutes: 5
